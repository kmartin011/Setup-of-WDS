<h1>Deployment of Image from WDS</h1>
<p>Once I had finished all the setup on the WDS server (WSUS-Client). I created a new VM on VMware which didnâ€™t contain any image files or any configuration. This was a blank machine. I set the network adapter to use the same adapter that my WDS Server was using (Vnet 4). I then started the PC up and was asked to press enter for network boot service. The configuration is complete.</p>

<p>At this point, Windows has successfully deployed. You may continue through the process as normal once you have entered your login credentials.</p>
