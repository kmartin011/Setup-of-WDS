<h1>Configuration of WDS</h1>

<h2>Creation of a Hard Drive to House all Images</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to store all the images you may want to deploy to devices on one drive. I created a new drive on another machine that was already on my domain (WSUS-Client) to house all the images I needed. To do this I simply opened VMware and navigated to the settings of the VM and added a new 50GB Hard Drive.

<br>
I then went into the machine and opened disk manager by right clicking the windows button. Inside disk manager I took the disk online and then initialized it. I gave it a volume letter of W and called it WDS.</p>

<h2>Configuration of WDS on Server</h2>

<p>Once I had configured my WSUS-Client machine with a new volume to host all my image files. Iâ€™d have to point to it so that WDS would know where to get the image files from. In order to get to do this, I simply opened server manager and right clicked my management server and opened DHCP manager. Inside here I expanded my DHCP scope and selected scope options, I then right clicked and selected configure options. In the scope options menu, I navigated to numbers 66 and 67 where I put the name of the WSUS-Client which holds all my image file and specified the bootfile name.
