<h1>Installation of WDS role on Server</h1>
<p>
  In order to install the WDS server role on the Management server, first open Server Manager and navigate to the Add Roles and Features Window. On the destination server page, I chose my local server as it would be the server that deploys WDS. 
<br>
  On the select server roles page, I selected Windows Deployment Services. On the next page all the features that were required for Windows Server Update Services was already installed, I just clicked next. I kept the default for the next two pages including the Select Role Services page where I left both boxes checked so this server could be used as the deployment and transport server.

<p>
  I then clicked next and Install to start the installation process.
